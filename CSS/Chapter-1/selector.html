        <h3><u>Group Selector</u></h3>
       
        <p> We can do classing in groups so that the group of tag can get a same style
        </p>    
<hr><pre><p1>
WE CAN ADD AS MANY AS TAGS ID OR CLASS WHILE DEFINING THE RULES OF THE STYLE
H1,H3,H5,DIV{
COLOR : BLUE;
}
WE CAN SELECT ELEMENTS LIKE THIS ALSO
P.red{
Color : red ;
}
In this case all the paragraph of class red is made of color red all the rules also gets implemented

*  is the selector which selects all the elements in the page
*{
margin : 0;
padding: 0;
}
The style defined in the last rule will be applicable to the elements
Like in the style sheet the color is red and in the style tag after it has the different style of same type then the style of the style tag will be considered
